Command Line Options
====================

/v?     Video device.  The argument is a single letter.  The meaning is the
        same as in interactive mode.

/a?     Audio device.  The argument is a single letter.  The meaning is the
        same as in interactive mode.

/p????  Port override for audio device.  The argument consists of up to four
        hexadecimal digits.  A value of 0 restores the default behavior.

/m      Start with music disabled.

/n      Start with sound effects disabled.

/i      Start with inverted colors (2-color CGA) or the two middle colors
        swapped (4-color CGA).  For the ATI Graphics Solution's 640x200x16
        mode, /i requests MDA compatible timings.

/r?     Rotate the NTSC composite CGA palette 0, 1, 2 or 3 times on startup.

/g      Switch 16-color modes to grayscale.  Argument: Either none or your
        monitor's gray ramp described by the 16 CGA color indices (hexadeci-
        mal) sorted by ascending brightness.  If no argument is specified, a
        (possibly sub-optimal) default gray ramp is used.  In CGA modes, /g
        disables the NTSC color signal and adjusts the palette, if possible.

/s      Tentatively reserved for story mode.

/o?     Override tile set: Use artwork with 2 or 4 bits per pixel for modes
        that would otherwise use 8.  Also tells the engine to use TDY instead
        of CMP artwork (/o4) and/or CGA instead of CG2 artwork (/o2).
        If both are specified, modes based on the 8 bit artwork will follow
        the rightmost occurrence of /o.

/f      Override sanity checks.  The program will blindly try to initialize
        the hardware specified with /v and /a.

/c?     Set the one freely selectable color (i.e. background or foreground)
        in CGA mode to the color specified by a single hexadecimal digit.
        If the argument is omitted, the default behavior is restored,
        overriding any previous use of /c.


You can write your favorite configuration to a batch file by using echo:

    echo "px3_ose /va /ab /i" > px3.bat


File Handling
=============

Planet X3 OSE will look for game assets in the current working directory,
followed by drive A, followed by drive B.  As a last resort, it will ask for
a disk containing the respective file.
Savegames are always read from and written to the current working directory.

Keyboard Commands
=================

Planet X3 OSE supports the following not self-documenting keyboard commands:

cursor keys     move unit or cursor
Enter           select unit, building or menu entry
Space           fire
TAB, +, =       cycle through units
-               cycle through units (backwards)
PgDn, ]         cycle through buildings
PgUp, [         cycle through buildings (backwards)
Shift + 0-9     save hotkey for active unit or building *
0-9             select unit or building via hotkey *

* In the intro menu, these keys control the jukebox, instead.

Gameplay Essentials
===================

Buildings
---------

Headquarters    You start with this building.  Your enemies will come for it.
Radar station   Can scan for this and that and provides valuable intelligence.
Smelter         Gets minerals by smelting crystals and rocks you place nearby.
Gas refinery    Sources gas from natural volcano-like gas vents it sits on.
Factory         Can build various vehicles or vessels.
Solar panel     Provides energy to a power station it is connected to.
Power station   Makes the solar energy available to you.
Missile silo    Can build and launch nuclear missiles.

Units
-----

Builder         It can build buildings. (Duh!) It can also carry stuff.
Tank            Can fire its cannon at various targets. Can also self-destruct
                with an explosion.
Heavy tank      Can fire its cannon at various targets. Can be used in statio-
                nary, sentry mode to automatically shoot at enemy units.
Frigate         This is basically a swimming tank. The factory needs to be at
                the shore to build one.
Scout           Can be used to explore the map. Cannot do anything else, yet.
Soldier         As you can imagine, this one is not built in a factory.
                For the time being, they are nowhere to be found.
Fighter jet     Your researchers are still figuring out how to build these and
                what to do with them. However, no factory will be able to
                build both, frigates and fighter jets.
